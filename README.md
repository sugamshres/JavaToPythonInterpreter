# JavaToPythonInterpreter
• Worked on a project in Java that interprets statements considering them as Python commands and displays the results accordingly. The program handles the assignment, saving and retrieving of the entered values.
• The final Interpreter class was built upon Tokenizer, Parser and Evaluator classes respectively. Used the concepts of Context-Free-Grammar, Regular Expressions and Recursive Models extensively.
